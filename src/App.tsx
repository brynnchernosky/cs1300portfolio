            Physics simulations are common teaching tools for introductory
            physics teachers everywhere. They help students learn about
            everything from free body diagrams to Newton&apos;s laws, and bridge
            the gap between visual and mathematical representations. But many
            physics simulations only provide limited interactivityâ€”they
            don&apos;t give students a chance to test their knowledge by solving
            problems or explain the concepts they represent.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I developed the physics simulation platform, PhySims, to bridge this
            gap, allowing students a choice between freeform mode, review mode,
            and tutorial mode to learn various introductory mechanics topics.

          <h3>Freeform Mode</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            In Freeform Mode, students can explore pendulum problems, incline
            plane problems, and more, toggling parameters and running
            simulations with mathematically correct forces. They can also
            visualize force, acceleration, and velocity vectors alongside their
            mathematical representations.

          <h3>Tutorial Mode</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            In Tutorial Mode, students receive step-by-step guidance on how to
            solve different categories of problems, with visual depictions and
            mathematical notation accompanying each step.{" "}

          <h3>Review Mode</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            In Review Mode, students can practice their problem-solving skills
            by solving randomly generated problems. Students can sketch out free
            body diagrams; solve for forces, angles, and coefficients; and run
            their own custom-designed simulations.{" "}
